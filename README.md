# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository contains C++ implementations of various data structures and algorithms.

## Contents

### Linked List
- **Singly Linked List**: A template-based implementation including insertion, deletion, reversal (iterative and recursive), and printing.
- **Doubly Linked List**: A template-based implementation including insertion, deletion, reversal and printing.
- **Stack**: A template-based implementation with both Linked Lists and Arrays. Including push, pop, top and isEmpty. Some example algorithms such as string reversing or balanced parentheses are also implemented.
- **Queue**: A template-based implementation with both Linked Lists and Arrays. Includes enqueue, dequeue, peek and isEmpty.
