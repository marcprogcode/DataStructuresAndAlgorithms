# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository contains C++ implementations of various data structures and algorithms.

## Contents

### Linked List
- **Singly Linked List**: A template-based implementation including insertion, deletion, reversal (iterative and recursive), and printing.
- **Doubly Linked List**: A template-based implementation including insertion, deletion, reversal and printing.
- **Stack**: A template-based implementation with both Linked Lists and Arrays. including push, pop, top and isEmpty. Some example algorithms such as string reversing or balanced parentheses are also implemented.

## Getting Started

1. Open `DataStructuresAndAlgorithms.sln` in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution (Ctrl+Shift+B).
3. Run the projects (F5 or Ctrl+F5).

## Requirements
- C++ Compiler (supporting C++11 or later)
- Visual Studio (recommended) or any other C++ IDE
